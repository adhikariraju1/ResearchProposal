## What is the Research Question:

Does income inequality affect the environment?


## Importance of the research question:

Income inequality is one of the biggest issues grappling both developing and developed countries alike. While most development agendas in the past have focused heavily on poverty, it has been clearly established that income inequality is the pressing issue now. The UN Sustainable Development Goals have also put a strong emphasis on income inequality. Increased urbanization and growing reliance on international trade have made the differences between the poor and the rich even more bigger and through globalization it has become more visible to all. Inequality has been looked upon a cause to many social, political and economic crisis around the world. Plethora of research on inequality show that it affects education, healthcare, economy, and even voter turnout and elections in many countries. However, the focus of our research is not going to be in any of these social or political issues. We aim to research the effect of inequality on environment. The reason we find this interesting is because climate change is one of the biggest threats of our generation. Yet it is very much disconnected with other social and economic issues that scholars usually talk about. Showing a relationship between inequality and environment can be extremely important to create a better roadmap for development since policymakers may find better approaches to solve these issues if they are somehow related.

## Literature Review:

A few scholars are starting to connect the dots and analyze the relationship between inequality and environment.  Nobel Laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz argues that inequality can contribute to environmental degradation because the poor tend to have less interest in pursuing policies designed to protect the environment and therefore good environment policies will be less supported. (1) He also argues that the relationship goes both ways in the sense that good environmental policies will help build social cohesion and reduce inequality. (2) Nazrul Islam, a Senior Economic Affairs Officer at the Development Policy Analysis Division of UN DESA provides an analytical framework to explain negative correlations between inequality and quality of environment and suggests that reducing inequality will help protect the environment. (3) He adds that gender inequality is another dimension that affects environment thus providing us even more reason to examine this case. (3)
